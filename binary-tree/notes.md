# Binary trees

Binary trees are a basic data structure comprised of parent nodes and child nodes such that each parent will have no more than two child nodes. 

## Binary search tree

Binary search tree nodes are sorted with greater values to the right branch and nodes of lesser values are sorted to the left. A balanced binary search tree can yield a O complexity of O(log n)

* Inorder traversal: left - root - right
* Preorder traversal: root - left - right
* Preorder traversal: left - right - root
